## What is Freedy?
Freedy is a free and simple RSS/ Atom reader for the browser, written in Python with Flask. This is our first web application, so if there are any fatal mistakes, feel free to tell us!

## Features
- Small footprint on performance
- Add as many feeds as you like!
- Amount of the recent posts shown of each feed can be configured

## Usage
You basically just need to clone the repo, create a virtualenv for the project and then run the flask/gunicorn server. We also recommend using a reverse proxy (eg. nginx) in front of the app.

Detailed instructions + Docker deployment will follow soon.
